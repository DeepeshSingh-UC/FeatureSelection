# FEATURE SELECTION


Feature Selection is the process where we automatically or manually select those features which contribute most to our prediction variable or output in which we are interested in. Having irrelevant features in our data can decrease the accuracy of the models and make our model learn based on irrelevant features.

So I used python codes to perform this process.
